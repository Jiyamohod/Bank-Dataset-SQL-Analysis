# 📊 MyBankDB Project

## 📌 Overview
**MyBankDB** is a sample relational database project that simulates a **banking system**. The project includes structured datasets in CSV format and is designed for practicing **SQL queries, database design, and data analysis** within a realistic financial domain.
This repository is ideal for:
* Beginners learning SQL with real-world datasets.
* Students working on database management projects.
* Professionals practicing query optimization and business reporting.

## 🗂️ Datasets
The project consists of **7 CSV files**, each representing a key banking entity:

1. **Customers** – Details of account holders (e.g., names, ages, demographics).
2. **Accounts** – Information about customer accounts, balances, types, and statuses.
3. **Transactions** – Records of deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
4. **Loans** – Loan amounts, interest rates, start/end dates, and repayment details.
5. **Credit Cards** – Card numbers, credit limits, balances, and customer associations.
6. **Branches** – Bank branch locations and identifiers.
7. **ATMs** – Locations and operational statuses of ATM machines.

## 🎯 Objectives
Using this dataset, you can:

* Build and explore a complete **banking database system**.
* Practice **joins, aggregations, subqueries, grouping, and filtering**.
* Analyze **customer behavior, financial performance, and service usage**.
* Generate insights such as:

  * Customers with multiple accounts.
  * Active vs inactive accounts.
  * Loan and credit utilization.
  * ATM service availability.
  * Age group segmentation of customers.
  * 
## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Import Data**

   * Load the provided CSV files into your preferred database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

2. **Create Database Schema**

   * Define tables for Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Loans, Credit Cards, Branches, and ATMs.

3. **Explore Queries**

   * Run analysis and reporting queries on the data to simulate real banking operations.

## 📊 Example Use Cases
With this project, you can explore:

* Financial reporting (total loans, total balances, total credit limits).
* Customer analysis (average age, active customers, segmentation).
* Transaction analysis (latest transaction per account, monthly summaries).
* Risk assessment (loans with high interest rates, over-limit credit cards).
* Operational analysis (inactive ATMs, inactive accounts).

## 🤝 Contributions
Contributions are welcome! You can:

* Add more sample datasets (e.g., Employees, Services).
* Suggest new SQL scenarios and business cases.
* Improve documentation for learners.
